# How To Contribute

First of all, **thank you** for contributing to this library!

## Issues
Please file issues on the [GitHub issues list](https://github.com/meducation/css_toolkit/issues) and give as much detail as possible.

## Features / Pull Requests

If you want to make a change, the best way to get it done is to submit a pull request that implements it.

There is an embedded Rails app preloaded with toolkit elements. You can view it by running:

```
cd /PATH_TO_THIS_FILE/test/dummy
rails s
```

If you've not contributed to a repository before - this is the accepted pattern to use:

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

Thank you again!
